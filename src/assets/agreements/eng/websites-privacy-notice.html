We have also set out some legal reasons why we may process your Personal Information (these also depend on what category of Personal Information we are processing). We normally process Personal Information if this is necessary to provide the services set out in a contract, it is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests or it is required or allowed by any law that applies.

                    <li>
                        <p>    with your permission. As is best practice, we will only ask you for permission to process your Personal Information if there is no other legal reason to process it. If we need to ask for your permission, we will make it clear that this is what we are asking for, and ask you to confirm your choice to give us that permission. If we cannot provide a product or service without your permission we will make this clear when we ask for your permission. If you later withdraw your permission, we may no longer be able to provide you with a product or service that relies on having your permission.

                <p>
                    A cookie, also known as a browser cookie, is a text file containing small amounts of information which a server may download to your computer, mobile or tablet when you visit a website or use an app. Cookies reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you if you return to the Site from the same computer and through the same browser, however Bupa cannot identify you from the data that cookies collect; we collect anonymous user preferences and website behaviors only, for marketing purposes. There are different types of cookies which are used to do different things, such as letting you navigate between different pages on a website efficiently, remembering preferences you have given and helping us to identify ways to improve your overall site experience. Others are used to provide you with advertising which is more tailored to your interests or to measure the number of site visits and the most popular pages users visit.  
                </p>



                <p>
                    Each type of cookie can be set and controlled by the operator of the website which the user is browsing such as Bupa (known as a ‘first party cookie’) or a third party such as Facebook, for example to display advertisements and social sharing features, (known as a ‘third party cookie’). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to their core role of enhancing and enabling usability or site processes, disabling certain cookies may prevent you from using certain aspects of the Bupa website, such as generating a quote or placing an order. Broadly speaking, there are two different types of browser cookies: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Session cookies are stored in the computer's memory during a user's browsing session and are automatically deleted from the user's computer when the browser is closed or the session is deemed to have ended. These cookies usually store a session ID that is not personally identifiable to users, allowing the user to move from page to page without having to log-in repeatedly. They are widely used by commercial websites, for example to keep track of items that a consumer has added to a shopping basket. Session cookies do not collect any information from the user's computer and they expire at the end of the user's browser session. They can also become inaccessible after the session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually 20 or 30 minutes. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Persistent cookies are stored on the user's computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies can be used to retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions. Persistent cookies usually assign a unique ID to the user’s browser and they are usually configured to identify a user for a prolonged period of time, from days to months or even years. 
                        </p>

                <p>
                    Bupa only uses browser cookies to measure non-Personal Information, for example to learn about the behavior of visitors to our website and how they respond to our marketing communications. The more we learn, the better we are able to provide relevant and interesting content and services.

                <p>
