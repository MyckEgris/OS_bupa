                <h5>BUPA GLOBAL’S COMMITMENT </h5>

                <p>Bupa
                    people care. Our strong caring, ethics, dedication and respect are valued by people at some of the
                    most
                    vulnerable times in their lives. So trust is intrinsic to the way we operate as a business. At the
                    heart of our global
                    business are our values; these ar
                    e the principles that determine the way we, both as a company and as employees,
                    behave and believe. Preserving confidentiality and protecting the information with which we have
                    been entrusted are
                    two of the basic principles under which Bupa conducts its business. </p>


                <p>We are required by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“U.S. DHHS”) privacy
                    regulations
                    issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“
                    Original
                    HIPAA”), as amended
                    by the
                    Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, Title XIII of the American
                    Recovery and
                    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and as further amended by the Final Rule issued on January 25,

                    ITECH, and the Final Rule are collectively referred to as “HIPAA”), and any
                    subsequent amendments to HIPAA

                    prohibits or materially
                    limits our uses and disclosures of PHI, as set forth below, we will restrict our uses and/or dis
                    closures of your PHI in
                    accordance with the more stringent standard. We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice so
                    long as it
                    remains in effect. </p>

                    in any form or medium, that is created or received by Bupa that reasonably can be used to identify
                    you, and that
                    relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health condition; the provis
